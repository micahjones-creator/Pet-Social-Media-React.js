### Requires React Libraries to function properly
### Compile with node.js/npm, yarn, etc before running the source code

- **LifeCycle Methods**
- Props
- Hooks and data passing methods
- Data Fetching *[data fetching is simulated by set delay (only)]*
- JSX Injection (methods and render)

**This code builds on the original Codecademy.com pet-social-media project in their React.js Course** 

**App.js runs on localhost:8000 by default 'out of the box'**

==No public back-end support==
